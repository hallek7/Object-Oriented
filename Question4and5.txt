4)interfaces and implementation?

 # Interfaces and implementation is the difference between 
what the user needs to know and what the user does not need to know.
What the user needs to know or see interface where they  able to click and
submit an online order for example. The backend me mechanism and  implementation of data,
design and code that drivers the interface is  hidden from the user. 

5) How would you design an interface structure such that all of the possible implementations
 could store data effectively?
 # we can design a class with a method to store data and implement a function. And design an
 # interface for a specific storage devise to  call the method to implement the data to end user (the device).
